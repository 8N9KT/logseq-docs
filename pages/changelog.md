			- How to create a function below the query table? #card
				- Firstly, you have a query like this: 
				  query-table:: true
				  query-properties:: [:block :author :publication-date :price :qty :updated-at]
				  {{query (property type book)}} 
				  Then, you can create functions (by trigger `/function`) as this query block's children.
				  
				  For example:
					- How many books? `{{function (sum :qty)}}`
						- Answer: {{function (sum :qty)}}
					- What's the average price? `{{function (average :price)}}`
						- Answer: {{function (average :price)}}
					- How much does it cost to buy all of them? `{{function (sum (map (fn [x] (* (:price x) (:qty x))) result))}}`
						- Answer: {{function (sum (map (fn [x] (* (:price x) (:qty x))) result))}}
			- What features does it support?
				-
				  #+BEGIN_NOTE
				  The property to be used in the function must be a keyword, a keyword has a `:` at the beginning.
				  For example, `:price` is a keyword while `price` is not.
				  #+END_NOTE
				- Aggregations including sum/average/min/max/total
					- `{{function (sum :property)}}`
					- `{{function (average :property)}}`
					- `{{function (min :property)}}`
					- `{{function (max :property)}}`
					- `{{function (total :property)}}`
				- [[Clojure]] function!
				  The function takes the query result and bind it to the symbol `result` for usage.
					- `{{function (sum (map (fn [x] (* (:price x) (:qty x))) result))}}`
