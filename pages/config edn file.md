- Most of the `Settings` you've toggled in UI will be stored in `logseq/config.edn` file inside your graph folder
- Some of the advanced or experimental setting options can also be set in this file directly.
- A clean raw version of `config.edn` can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logseq/logseq/master/templates/config.edn)
