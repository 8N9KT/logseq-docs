- #+BEGIN_TIP
  For people familiar with Roam Research: the Journals page in Logseq is the same as the Daily Notes Page in Roam.
  #+END_TIP
- Every time you open Logseq, you start on the Journals page.
- The Journals page is the ideal place to enter information in your graph. Every day at midnight a new Journals page is created with that day's date, making it easy to see when you've added what information.
- The Journals page also functions as a resurfacing area; in the linked references of each day's Journals page you'll see the mentions of that day's date. This is handy for when you want to send your future self reminders or TODOs.
